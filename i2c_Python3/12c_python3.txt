You might also need to install python3-dev. Here is my revised set of instructions.


sudo apt-get update


sudo apt-get install python3-dev


wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/i/i2c-tools/i2c-tools_3.1.1.orig.tar.bz2


tar -xf i2c-tools_3.1.1.orig.tar.bz2


cd i2c-tools-3.1.1/py-smbus


cp smbusmodule.c smbusmodule.c.orig   m# make backup



Get the code from http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-i2c/msg08427.html and replace the content of smbusmodule.c with that code.
Replace


#include <linux/i2c-dev.h>


with


#include "i2c-dev.h"


Download a 2.x version of lm-sensors from http://lm-sensors.org/wiki/Download and unpack it. (I had some issues trying to use tar or Xarchiver on my Pi, but managed just fine using 7-Zip on a PC).
Copy kernel/i2c-dev.h to the directory containing your modified smbusmodule.c
Run the following commands.


    python3 setup.py build
    sudo python3 setup.py install


Now if you start Idle 3 you should be able to include smbus in your code without problems.
Thanks to everyone who contributed above and got me this far.
