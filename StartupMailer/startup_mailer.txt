Email IP address on Boot


Reference: http://elinux.org/RPi_Email_IP_On_Boot_Debian

This code will extract the ip address of your Pi and then send an email containing the ip to the specified email address. This is inspired by the need to access the Pi via SSH or other network protocols without a monitor and moving from network to network. This assumes a Gmail SMTP server.

The code also writes several operating parameters to a file which can be updated periodically  

Create or locate the python script: startup_mailer.py

Create directory “ code “ in the home/pi  directory  and sysstat_file

		mkdir code
		mkdir sysstat_file


Place startup_mailer.py in /home/pi/code/startup_mailer.py

		cp /home/pi/RpiNotes/StartupMailer/startup_mailer.py /home/pi/code/startup_mailer.py

Make a copy of the existing rc.local file 

		sudo cp /etc/rc.local  /etc/rc.local.original


Move modified rc local file to /etc/rc.local

	sudo cp /home/pi/RpiNotes/StartupMailer/rc.local /etc/rc.local

Reboot to test 


FIXME;  install update mailer, cron job




OR Edit /etc/rc.local

		sudo nano /etc/rc.local


Replace content of /etc/rc.local :


# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.
# Print the IP address if it doesn't work add sleep 30 before all your code 

sleep 30

_IP=$(hostname -I) || true
if [ "$_IP" ]; then
  printf "My IP address is %s\n" "$_IP"
  python /home/pi/code/startup_mailer.py
fi
exit 0
