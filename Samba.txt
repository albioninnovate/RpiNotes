Samba Share with windows 

Ref: http://raspberrypihq.com/how-to-share-a-folder-with-a-windows-computer-from-a-raspberry-pi/

Install:
sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin


Edit:

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Uncomment and change:

workgroup = WORKGROUP
wins support = yes


You can use anything as your workgroup name as long as it is alphanumerical and matches the workgroup you would like to join. The default workgroup in Windows 7 is WORKGROUP.

At the end of the smb.conf insert: 

[home]
 	comment=Raspberry Pi home directory 
 	path=/home/pi/
 	browsable=Yes
 	writeable=Yes
 	only guest=no
 	create mask=0777
 	directory mask=0777
	 public=no

Close smb.conf


Add pi as Samba user: 

	sudo smbpasswd -a pi
